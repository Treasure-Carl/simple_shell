The Simple Shell Project
=======================

![Simple shell](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/235/shell.jpeg "Write a simple UNIX command interpreter")

The shell manages the interaction between you and the operating system by prompting you for input, interpreting that input for the operating system, and then handling any resulting output from the operating system. Shells provide a way for you to communicate with the operating system.

## Principles

The shell project is a group project. That means you will be paired with someone. You already did this with printf, so please apply everything you have learned from the printf experience here. A quick reminder, that a group project is NOT:

- I do nothing and cross fingers for my partner to do everything so I can have a good score
- I do everything because I am so much better than my partner and I don’t care about them
- A group project at ALX SE is a project that both of you are responsible for. Everything anyone pushes to Github is the responsibility of both partners. It is not ok to say later “I didn’t cheat it’s my partner I didn’t know they didn’t tell me”.
- If you plan on not working on the shell project (or if at any point in time you can’t), itis your responsibility to tell both the staff and your partner so that they can find anotherpartner who will work with them asap.
So you are supposed to work TOGETHER. And you should both understand every single line of code that any of you pushes. Here is a link for you to read about pair programming: https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/121.

## Audience

The Shell project is intended for engineers, intergrators, and enthusiasiasts looking to modefy, hack, fix, experiment, and add to the base functions for the terminal.
The shell is an incredibly cool project. GL HF!

## Collaborators

This simple shell project was a sole collaboration, **Treasure Olayinka** an Alx learner built this project implimenting necessary functions needed to run a terminal.
